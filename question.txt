1.Inheritance 1 - Illustration

The task is to calculate the area of the shape using a menu driven application.

Write a Java program to Implement this task.

Create a class called Shape.

Include the following protected data members / attributes:

shapeName – of type String

Include the following methods :

Create a constructor that initializes the shapeName

calculateArea –  The return type of this method is Double. This method returns 0.

 

Create a class called Square that extends Shape

Include the following private data members / attributes:

side – of type Integer.

Include the following methods :

Create a constructor that initializes the side. (1-argument constructor). Initialize the shapeName as "Square".

calculateArea – calculates and returns the area of the square. The return type of this method is Double.

Create a class called Rectangle that extends Shape

Include the following private data members / attributes:

length – of type Integer.

breadth – of type Integer.

Include the following methods :

Create a constructor that initializes the length and breadth. (2-argument constructor). Initialize the shapeName as "Rectangle".

calculateArea - calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. The return type of this method is Double.

Create a class called Circle that extends Shape

Include the following private data members / attributes:

radius – of type Integer.

Include the following methods :

Create a constructor that initializes the radius. (1-argument constructor). Initialize the shapeName as "Circle".

calculateArea – calculates and returns the area of the circle. The return type of this method is Double.

 

Include appropriate getters and setters.

2.Abstract Class I – Shape

[Adhere to the OOPs specifications specified here. Follow the naming conventions for getters and setters. Download the template code provided and fill in the missing code]

 

Create an abstract class named Shape with the following protected attributes / member variables.

String name

Include a 1-argument constructor.

Include getters and setters.

Include an abstract method named calculateArea() . This method returns a Float value.

Create a class named Circle . The class Circle is a derived class of Shape. Include the following private attributes / member variables.

Integer radius

Include a 2-argument constructor. The order of the arguments is name, radius.

Include getters and setters.

Override the abstract method calculateArea() defined in the Shape class. This method returns the area of the circle. [Take the value of pi as 3.14]

Create a class named Square . The class Square is a derived class of Shape. Include the following private attributes / member variables.

Integer side

Include a 2-argument constructor. The order of the arguments is name, side.

Include getters and setters.

Override the abstract method calculateArea() defined in the Shape class. This method returns the area of the square.

Create a class named Rectangle . The class Rectangle is a derived class of Shape. Include the following private attributes / member variables.

Integer length

Integer breadth

Include a 3-argument constructor. The order of the arguments is name, length, breadth

Include getters and setters.

Override the abstract method calculateArea() defined in the Shape class. This method returns the area of the rectangle.

Create another class called Main. In the method, create instances of the above classes and test the above classes.

Input and Output Format:
